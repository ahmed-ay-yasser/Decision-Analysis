# Decision-Analysis
The project focuses on analyzing decision alternatives using the payoff table. It has two conditions: under uncertainty "without probabilities" (by applying the three approaches: optimistic, pessimistic and regret) and under risk "with probabilities" (by calculating the EVUR and EVUC to get the EVPI). The project is done using C# language.
